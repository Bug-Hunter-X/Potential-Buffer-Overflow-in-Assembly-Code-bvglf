This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code.  The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking before adding the values at [ebp+8] and [ebp+12] and storing the result at [ebp-4].  This could lead to a buffer overflow if the sum exceeds the allocated size of the buffer. The solution introduces proper bounds checking to mitigate this risk.
